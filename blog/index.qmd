To best ensure that the on-campus learners develop individually in their
capacity as team members, everyone partners with the course instructor to draft,
write, review, and publish these posts that support class discussions. These
articles represent the current state of a person's knowledge and skills in both
the technical and professional aspects of software engineering.
