# Introduction

This is the GitHub repository for the [Developer
Development](http://developerdevelopment.com/) web site! This web site contains
the materials for an undergraduate course in the field of software engineering.

The course involves the investigate of technical and professional materials in
these books:

- [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book)
(abbreviated on this site as **SE**): a compelling introduction to the processes
and tools used by software engineers at Google.
- [Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/) (abbreviated on this site as
**FB**): a savvy, code-focused introduction to the automated tools and
techniques for generating software tests.
- [Debugging Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/) (abbreviated on this site as
**DB**): an interactive introduction to automated methods for finding programmer
errors and their causes.

Since a component of developing as a developer is the specification, design,
implementation, testing, and deployment of production quality software, the
students in this course focus creating and maintaining open source software such
as the following projects:

- [Cellveyor](https://github.com/GatorEducator/cellveyor): Easily convey
reports from Google Sheets to GitHub
- [Chasten](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten): Check a program's AST for
specific code patterns
- [ExecExam](https://github.com/GatorEducator/execexam): Run executable
examinations to assess programming skills
- [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade): Python front-end
for the GatorGrader assessment tool
- [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader): Automated
assessment for source code and writing
